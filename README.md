# Web_Scraping-Challenge

For the Challenge 12, we were asked to complete a web-scraping and data analysis for the Mission to Mars.  Using HTML elements we have been asked to extract information and browsing with Spliter and parsing the data with BeautifulSoup.  The outcome of this challenge should enforce our past learnings; collecting data, organizing and properly storing the data, analysing, and then communicating our findings.

Programs Utilized
- Jupyter Notebook
- Beautiful Soup
- Splinter
- Python
- Pandas


## Part 1
### Web Scraping of Mars News
Using Jupyter notebook, I browsed the Mars NASA News site.  After inspecting the page, scraping elements were identficied.  BeautifulSoup was utilized to extract website elements. Data was stored in a Python dictionary. An optional task was to store the scraped data in a JSON or MangoDB database. 

## 2
### Analysis of Mars Weather
Using BeautifulSoup we scraped some data from the website and stored it into a Pandas DataFrame. Data analysis was then done on the weather. The DataFrame was exported into a CSV file.
